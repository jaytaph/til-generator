# Press twice for double quotes

Sometimes in Windows you need to press space after typing a double/single quote, it will wait for another character so it can type accents and such. Normally, this is remedied by 
changing your language from `US INTERNATIONAL` to `US (QWERTY)`. But even then it happens sometimes. THis is most likely due to the fact that your keyboard mapping is set incorrect.

win-space will let you toggle between the different mappings. I still haven't figured out how to remove those mappings there and just use a single mapping instead.
